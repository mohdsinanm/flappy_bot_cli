    Checks if the player has lost all lives in the game.

    This function evaluates the number of hits the player has taken. If the number of hits
    reaches zero, it clears the console, displays a "GAME OVER" message along with the final score,
    and returns True to indicate that the game should end.

    Parameters:
        hit (int): The current number of lives remaining for the player.
        count (int): The current score of the player.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the game is over (when hit is 0), False otherwise.
